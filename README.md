# Speech-Recognition-System-Machine-Learning-k-mean-algorithm-
Recogniting mood by taking voice sample of person on analysing pitch, frequency of voice sample and 
applying k-mean clusting algorithm of machine learning.


This project is based on machine learning. In this we are detecting 
the mood (sad, happy, angry, excited, irritated, and enthusiastic) of the person by using k-mean 
clustering algorithm by the analysis of pitch, frequency and amplitude of voice sample.
Platform/Technologies used: Matlab/ Machine Learning Algorithm.
